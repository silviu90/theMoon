         <a id="text_main"> <b>The Moon</b> <br> Is a differentiated world. This means that it is
            composed of different layers with different compositions. The heaviest
             materials have sunken down into the Moon’s center, and the lightest
              materials have risen to the outermost layer. Seismic, rotational,
               and gravity measurement studies have allowed us to gain insights
                into the different layers within the Moon.</a>

         <a id="text_main"> <b>The light</b> <br> Areas of the Moon are known as the highlands. The dark features, called maria 
         (Latin for seas), are impact basins that were filled with lava between 4.2 and 1.2 billion years ago.
         These light and dark areas represent rocks of different composition and ages, which provide evidence
         for how the early crust may have crystallized from a lunar magma ocean. The craters themselves, which
         have been preserved for billions of years, provide an impact history for the Moon and other bodies in 
         the inner solar system.</a>

         <a id="text_main"> <b>Exploration</b> <br> The Moon was first visited by the Soviet Union’s uncrewed Luna 1 and 2 in 1959, and, as of April 2019, seven nations
             have followed. The U.S. sent three classes of robotic missions to prepare the way for human exploration: the Rangers (1961–1965) were impact probes,
             the Lunar Orbiters (1966–1967) mapped the surface to find landing sites, and the Surveyors (1966–1968) were soft landers.
            The first human landing on the Moon was on July 20, 1969. During the Apollo missions of 1969–1972,
             12 American astronauts walked on the Moon and used a Lunar Roving Vehicle to travel on the surface and extend their studies of soil mechanics, meteoroids, lunar ranging,
              magnetic fields, and solar wind. The Apollo astronauts brought back 382 kilograms (842 pounds) of rock and soil to Earth for study.</a>
